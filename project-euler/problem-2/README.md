# Project Euler Problem 2 - Even Fibonacci Numbers

> Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous
> two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:
>
> 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 43, 55, 89
>
> By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed
> four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

**Pseudocode:**

```txt
PRINT "Enter the maximum Fibonacci term that you want to calculate the sum up to:"
INPUT maximumTerm

previousTerm1 ← 1
previousTerm2 ← 1
total ← 0

WHILE previousTerm2 < maximumTerm
    fibonacciPoint ← previousTerm1 + previousTerm2

    previousTerm1 ← previousTerm2
    previousTerm2 ← fibonacciPoint

    IF (fibonacciPoint % 2) = 0
        total ← total + fibonacciPoint
    ENDIF
ENDWHILE

OUTPUT total
```
